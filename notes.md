1) For a height of 1km, 
Time taken for echo = 1000 / 343 * 2
Which is more than 4 seconds
So horizontal displacement in this time is too big to ignore

Assumptions:
1) The radius of view of the ultrasound sensor is short, so we don't get interference from the sides of the buildings
2) The simulator need not consider the horizontal displacement, as data is random data anyway

graph the data that you see

Intentionally ignoring the specifics of setups and reads for electronics sensors. We can rather learn it while working with actual electronics

Data generated at 1m/s

Maybe make the drone land at the end?
